# Introduction

Mercury is a metal present in the environment whose harmful effects on human health are well assessed [@park2012human]. In a study led in 2000 [@al2000factors], scientists collected data on total mercury and methyl mercury levels in the hair of 100 fishermen of Kuwait, aged 16 to 58 years, comparing them to those of a control population of 35 non-fishermen, aged 26 to 35 years. The aim of this report is to analyse the factors influencing the levels of mercury in both populations. For the sake of simplicity, we will only focus on total Hg, leaving out methyl mercury, as both variables are strongly correlated.

The dataset gathers information about six numerical variables (age, height, weight, number of fish meals per week and residence time in Kuwait) and two categorical ones (being a fisherman or not, fish consumption habits). There is no additional information about gender as all the participants in the study are males.

A first insight at the data shows that the fishermen population exhibits higher levels of mercury in their hair. The significance of the difference between the means of both distributions is assessed by a _Welch Two Sample t-test_ with the alternative hypothesis that the fishermen population has a average greater level of mercury than the control population (p-value = 7.473e-05).

```


# Exploratory analysis (Amandine)

#### Overview of the data 
Before fitting a model, let's have a look at the data. The following table shows the 8 conditions of fishmlwk according to the 2 possible conditions of fisherman.
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
table(dataset$fisherman, dataset$fishmlwk)
```
First, let's notice that for some variables, we have a very few people : only 2 people eat fish 3 times a week. We see also that the data are really unbalanced, because the fishermen and non fishermen are separated on the variable "fishmlwk" : the non fishermen don't eat fish more than 2 times a week, whereas the fishermen don't eat fish less than 3 times a week. 
Besides, we face the same unbalanced pattern for the variables "age"" and "restime".

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
ggplot(dataset, aes(age, TotHg, colour = fisherman)) + geom_point() #+ scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() ##Uncomment for log scales
ggplot(dataset, aes(restime, TotHg, colour = fisherman)) + geom_point()
ggplot(dataset, aes(fishmlwk, TotHg, colour = fisherman)) + geom_boxplot()
#grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol=3, nrow = 1)
```

#### Multicolinearity 

To check whether we have multicolinear variables, we use the VIF function. If all the variables have a result below 5, we keep them. 

```{r ,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hg.form.full = TotHg~ fisherman + age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart 
#hg.form.full2 = TotHg~ (fisherman + age + restime + height + weight + fishpart)^2
#hg.form.full3 = TotHg~ (fisherman + age + restime + height + weight + fishpart)^3

vif(lm(hg.form.full,data=dataset))
#vif(lm(hg.form.full2,data=dataset))
#vif(lm(hg.form.full3,data=dataset))
```
Indeed, we observe that all the variables have a VIF below 2, so we don't eliminate any variable, yet.

# Model selection (Joseph)

Now we are going to use and compare the different methods of model selection to select the more relevant parameters to explain the TotHg variations within the population.

## Stepwise selection

The first attempt is a stepwise selection based on a formula with all the parameters except for "fisherman". Indeed, the preliminary exploration has shown that the "fisherman" variable have considerable impact on many of the other variables. Therefore to understand what is the reason behind the TotHg difference between the 2 groups, it seems natural to start with a model without the "fisherman" variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hg.form.step1 = TotHg ~ age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart
model1 <- stepAIC(lm(hg.form.step1,data=dataset), direction="both")
summary(model1)
```

With stepwise selection, the selected model is : TotHg ~ weight + fishmlwk. The intercept and the two coefficients are very significant. Moreover the signs of the coefficients are not absurd: while it is not really intuitive that the weight coefficient should be positive or negative, the coefficient of fishmlwk had to be positive, and it's the case here.

Now to determine possible differences between the fishermen and non-fishermen, a model based on the interactions between the "fisherman" variable and all the others is proposed. This could show if a certain variable is very relevant concerning fishermen but less when it comes to non-fishermen, for instance.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hg.form.step2 = TotHg ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart)
model2 <- stepAIC(lm(hg.form.step2,data=dataset), direction="both")
summary(model2)
```

The best model is now : TotHg ~ fisherman:weight + fisherman:fishmlwk, ie the interactions between fisherman and the variables of the previous model. While the coefficients for fisherman0:weight and fisherman1:weight stays very significant, fisherman0:fishmlwk and fisherman1:fishmlwk are barely significant (but their p-value is very close to 0.05) ; this comes from the fact that within each of the subpopulation {fishermen} and {non-fishermen} the range in which fishmlwk varies is very reduced compared to the whole population (see the Exploratory analysis). Moreover, when looking at the values of the coefficients, it appears that for the non-fishermen, the number of fish meal per week has a very preponderant effect, while among fishermen, the contribution of weight of weight and fish meal per week are almost even.

## Other techniques of model selection

Now in order to check the dependency of the selected model to the selection technique, we are going to try backward and forward selection to check if similar models are obtained.

### Backward selection

```{r}
hg.form.bwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart)
drop1(lm(hg.form.custom, data = dataset), test="F")
#> Delete fisherman:fishpart

hg.form.bwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk)
drop1(lm(hg.form.custom, data = dataset), test="F")
#> Delete fisherman:age

hg.form.bwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:(restime + height + weight + fishmlwk)
drop1(lm(hg.form.custom, data = dataset), test="F")
#> Delete fisherman:restime

hg.form.bwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:(height + weight + fishmlwk)
drop1(lm(hg.form.custom, data = dataset), test="F")
#> Delete fisherman:height

hg.form.bwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:(weight + fishmlwk)
drop1(lm(hg.form.custom, data = dataset), test="F")
#> All parameters are significant (p-value < 0.05)
```

Backward selection gives the same model than stepwise selection.

### Forward selection

```{r}
hg.form.fwd = TotHg ~ 1
add1(lm(hg.form.fwd, data=dataset), test="F", scope = ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart))
#> Add fisherman:weight

hg.form.fwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:weight
add1(lm(hg.form.fwd, data=dataset), test="F", scope = ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart))
#> Add fisherman:fishmlwk

hg.form.fwd = TotHg ~ fisherman:weight + fisherman:fishmlwk
add1(lm(hg.form.fwd, data=dataset), test="F", scope = ~ fisherman:(age + restime + height + weight + fishmlwk + fishpart))
#> No more significant (p-value < 0.05) parameter to add
```

Forward selection also gives the same model than stepwise selection.

# Results and discussion (Urvan)

Fit model (* fishermen) (I picked the model given by stepwise selection)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hg.form.selected=TotHg ~  - 1 + fisherman + fisherman:(weight + fishmlwk)
hg.lm.selected.model=lm(hg.form.selected, data=dataset)
hg.lm.selected.summary <- summary(hg.lm.selected.model)
summary(hg.lm.selected.model)
```


This regression shows several intersting results:

First, we get two coefficients very significantly different from 0 (_p_ < 0.001), both concerning fisherman population. The fact that there are less significant coefficients for non-fisherman population could be explained by several causes:

- The non-fisherman population could be too small to properly show the size effect of those observables.
 
- The non-fisherman population may not have settled long enough in the place to have repercussion on the mercury levels.

However, those are only suppositions in order to explain the distribution of the _p_-values, but none of them have been proven.

On the other side, the number of meal composed of fish (_fishmlwk_) seems to be contributing to the mercury levels of both populations (_p_-values of `r format(hg.lm.selected.summary[["coefficients"]][5,4], digits=1)` for non-fisherman and `r format(hg.lm.selected.summary[["coefficients"]][6,4], digits=1)` for fisherman). However, we can see that there is a huge difference between the two contributions of a factor `r format(hg.lm.selected.summary[["coefficients"]][5,1]/hg.lm.selected.summary[["coefficients"]][6,1], digits=1)`.

However, the most significant coefficient is for _weight_ for fisherman populatio, with a _p_-value of `r format(hg.lm.selected.summary[["coefficients"]][4,4], digits=1, scientific=TRUE)`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=1) #residuals vs fitted
qplot(hg.lm.selected.model$fitted.values, hg.lm.selected.model$residuals, colour=dataset$fisherman, xlab = "fitted values", ylab = "residuals") + labs(colour = 'fisherman')
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=2) #QQ plot
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=3) #scale location
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=4) #cook's distance
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=5) #residuals vs leverage 
plot(hg.lm.selected.model, which=6) #cook's distance vs leverage
```
